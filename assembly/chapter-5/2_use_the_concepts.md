- Modify the `toupper` program so that it reads from `STDIN` and writes to `STDOUT` instead of using the files on the command line

`./1.s`


- Change the size of the buffer.

Whatever.


- Rewrite the program so that it uses storage in the `.bss` section rather than the stack to store the file descriptors.

`./2.s`


- Write a program that will create a file called `heynow.txt` and write the words "Hey diddle diddle!" into it.

`heynow.s`
