### Modify the `toupper` program so that it reads from `STDIN` and writes to `STDOUT` instead of using the files on the command line

`./stdin_stdout.s`


### Change the size of the buffer.

Whatever.


### Rewrite the program so that it uses storage in the `.bss` section rather than the stack to store the file descriptors.

`./buffd.s`


### Write a program that will create a file called `heynow.txt` and write the words "Hey diddle diddle!" into it.

`heynow.s`
